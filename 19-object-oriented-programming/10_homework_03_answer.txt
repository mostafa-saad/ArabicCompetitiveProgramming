The semantic is wrong. There is no clear and strong has-a relationship. Never do that in inheritance

A car is not an Engine. The car is not 4 wheels. Sometimes we can stack things like inheritance and it works for now (and be a big mess later)

The right relationship is composition. The car has an engine and 4-wheels

Prefer composition over inheritance most of the time, even if inheritance makes more sense unless it really should be an inheritance. Think twice.
