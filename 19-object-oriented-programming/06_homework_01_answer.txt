1- As this constructor is private, extrernal users can't make objects of such a class using this constructor!
	If this is the empty constructor and no further constructors, users can't create a class at all
	
	Why would that be benificial?!

2- if a copy constructor is made private, objects of that class become non-copyable. 
	
3- Why argument to a copy constructor must be passed as a reference?
	A copy constructor is called when an object is passed by value. 
	Copy constructor itself is a function. So if we pass an argument by value in a copy constructor, a call to copy constructor 
	would be made to call copy constructor ==> infinite recursion
	Therefore compiler doesnâ€™t allow parameters to be passed by value.
